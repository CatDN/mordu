# EOS
The beginnings of a python package which focuses on the creation and usage of equations of state (EOS) for both pure fluids and mixtures.

For now, mixtures will be limited to binary mixtures, as it is what currently interests me but will in the future be exapanded for any mixture.

The package will allow the user to define their own fluids and equations of state to then calculate fluid thermodynamic properties at a certain state.

Further functionality includes vapour liquid equilibria algorithms and P-x diagram creation.

(The symbol is a bear because I like bears).
